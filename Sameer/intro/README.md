# PLSQL


- Only use these notes for if you want to find something that I tried out
- **DO NOT USE THEM FOR THEORY STUFF**
- if you need theory notes:
https://github.com/joruzu/PLSQL-notes
- SkillCertPro answers/things I tried out are in the Practice Exams directory
- Also pdf stuff in the same directory
- If you find a code snippet on skillcertpro and want a more readable version of it just
control+f through all my files, it'll most likely be there
